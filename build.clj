;; branch of quil:

;; Processing.app/Contents/Java/core/library/

;; clj -T:build release

;; ... should build a release-able jar in the target sub-directory.

;; I have been able to use the produced jar as a local dep in a new
;; quil project, and everything seems to work as expected so far. If
;; you have a chance to do any testing on your local platform, please
