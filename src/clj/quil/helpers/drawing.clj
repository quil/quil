(defn line-join-points
  "Takes either a seq of x y (and z) point coords tuples or two
  separate lists of x and y (and z) coords independently and creates a
  lazy list of line args (vectors of 4 (or 6) elements) suitable for
  use with the [[quil.core/line]] function.

  Examples:
  ```
  (line-join-points [1 2 3] [4 5 6])     ;=> ([1 4 2 5] [2 5 3 6])
  (line-join-points [[1 4] [2 5] [3 6]]) ;=> ([1 4 2 5] [2 5 3 6])
  (line-join-points [[1 4 0] [2 5 1] [3 6 2]]) ;=> ([1 4 0 2 5 1]
                                               ;    [2 5 1 3 6 2])
  (line-join-points [1 2 3] [4 5 6] [0 1 2])   ;=> ([1 4 0 2 5 1]
                                               ;    [2 5 1 3 6 2])
