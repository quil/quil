  This function creates a bitmapped version of a font It loads a font

  the font. When possible, the text function will use a native font
  rather than the bitmapped version created behind the scenes with
  create-font. For instance, when using the default renderer
  setting (JAVA2D), the actual native version of the font will be
  employed by the sketch, improving drawing quality and
  performance. With the :p2d, :p3d, and :opengl renderer settings, the
  bitmapped version will be used. While this can drastically improve

  :threshold - converts the image to black and white pixels depending

               the level parameter. The level must be between
               0.0 (black) and 1.0 (white). If no level is specified,
               0.5 is used.
  :gray      - converts any colors in the image to grayscale
               equivalents. Doesn't work with level.
  :invert    - sets each pixel to its inverse value. Doesn't work with
               level.
  :posterize - limits each channel of the image to the number of
               colors specified as the level parameter. The parameter can
               be set to values between 2 and 255, but results are most
               noticeable in the lower ranges.
  :blur      - executes a Guassian blur with the level parameter
               specifying the extent of the blurring. If no level
               parameter is used, the blur is equivalent to Guassian
               blur of radius 1.
  :opaque    - sets the alpha channel to entirely opaque. Doesn't work
               with level.

    file. This is useful with the default (or JAVA2D) renderer
    setting, as it will improve font rendering speed. This is not

    because the type will look great on your machine (because you have
    the font installed) but lousy on others' machines if the identical
    font is unavailable. This option can only be set per-sketch, and
    must be called before any use of text-font.

  :disable-native-fonts - Disables native font support.

  :disable-depth-test - Disable the zbuffer, allowing you to draw on
    top of everything at will. When depth testing is disabled, items
    will be drawn to the screen sequentially, like a painting. This
    hint is most often used to draw in 3D, then draw in 2D on top of
    it (for instance, to draw GUI controls in 2D on top of a 3D
    interface). Starting in release 0149, this will also clear the
    depth buffer. Restore the default with :enable-depth-test
    but note that with the depth buffer cleared, any 3D drawing that
    happens later in draw will ignore existing shapes on the screen.

  :enable-depth-test - Enables the zbuffer.

  :enable-depth-sort - Enable primitive z-sorting of triangles and
    lines in :p3d and :opengl rendering modes. This can slow
    performance considerably, and the algorithm is not yet perfect.

  :disable-depth-sort - Disables hint :enable-depth-sort

  noise is a random sequence generator producing a more natural
  ordered, harmonic succession of numbers compared to the standard
  random function. It was invented by Ken Perlin in the 1980s and
  been used since in graphical applications to produce procedural
  textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc.

  The main difference to the random function is that Perlin noise is
  defined in an infinite n-dimensional space where each pair of
  coordinates corresponds to a fixed semi-random value (fixed only for
  the lifespan of the program). The resulting value will always be
  between 0.0 and 1.0. Processing can compute 1D, 2D and 3D noise,
  depending on the number of coordinates given. The noise value can be
  animated by moving through the noise space and the 2nd and 3rd
  dimensions can also be interpreted as time.

  The actual noise is structured similar to an audio signal, in
  respect to the function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept
  of harmonics in physics, perlin noise is computed over several
  octaves which are added together for the final result.

  Another way to adjust the character of the resulting sequence is the
  scale of the input coordinates. As the function works within an
  infinite space the value of the coordinates doesn't matter as such,
  only the distance between successive coordinates does (eg. when
  using noise within a loop). As a general rule the smaller the
  difference between coordinates, the smoother the resulting noise
  sequence will be. Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most
  applications, but this will differ depending on use."

  sequence. By default, noise is computed over 4 octaves with each
  octave contributing exactly half than its predecessor, starting at
  50% strength for the 1st octave. This falloff amount can be changed
  by adding an additional function parameter. Eg. a falloff factor of
  0.75 means each octave will now have 75% impact (25% less) of the
  previous lower octave. Any value between 0.0 and 1.0 is valid,
  however note that values greater than 0.5 might result in greater

  the visualisation.

  Available options:

   :size           - A vector of width and height for the sketch or :fullscreen.
                     Defaults to [500 300]. If you're using :fullscreen you may
                     want to enable present mode - :features [:present].
                     :fullscreen size works only in Clojure. In ClojureScript
                     all sketches are support fullscreen when you press F11.

   :renderer       - Specifies the renderer type. One of :p2d, :p3d, :java2d,
                     :opengl, :pdf). Defaults to :java2d. :dxf renderer
                     can't be used as sketch renderer. Use begin-raw method
                     instead. In clojurescript only :p2d and :p3d renderers
                     are supported.

   :output-file    - Specifies an output file path. Only used in :pdf mode.
                     Not supported in clojurescript.

   :title          - A string which will be displayed at the top of
                     the sketch window. Not supported in clojurescript.

   :features       - A vector of keywords customizing sketch behaviour.
                     Supported features:

                     :keep-on-top - Sketch window will always be above other
                                    windows. Note: some platforms might not
                                    support always-on-top windows.
                                    Not supported in clojurescript.

                     :exit-on-close - Shutdown JVM  when sketch is closed.
                                      Not supported in clojurescript.

                     :resizable - Makes sketch resizable.
                                  Not supported in clojurescript.

                     :no-safe-fns - Do not catch and print exceptions thrown
                                    inside functions provided to sketch (like
                                    draw, mouse-click, key-pressed and
                                    other). By default all exceptions thrown
                                    inside these functions are catched. This
                                    prevents sketch from breaking when bad
                                    function was provided and allows you to
                                    fix it and reload it on fly. You can
                                    disable this behaviour by enabling
                                    :no-safe-fns feature.
                                    Not supported in clojurescript.

                     :present - Switch to present mode (fullscreen without
                                borders, OS panels). You may want to use
                                this feature together with :size :fullscreen.
                                Not supported in ClojureScript. In ClojureScript
                                fullscreen is enabled by pressing F11 and it's
                                enabled on all sketches automatically.

                     :no-start - Disables autostart if sketch was created using
                                 defsketch macro. To start sketch you have to
                                 call function created defsketch.
                                 Supported only in ClojureScript.

                     :global-key-events - Allows a sketch to receive any
                                          keyboard event sent to the page,
                                          regardless of whether the canvas it is
                                          loaded in has focus or not.
                                          Supported only in ClojureScript.

                     Usage example: :features [:keep-on-top :present]

   :bgcolor        - Sets background color for unused space in present mode.
                     Color is specified in hex format: #XXXXXX.
                     Example: :bgcolor \"#00FFFF\" (cyan background)
                     Not supported in ClojureScript.

   :display        - Sets what display should be used by this sketch.
                     Displays are numbered starting from 0. Example: :display 1.
                     Not supported in ClojureScript.

   :setup          - A function to be called once when setting the sketch up.

   :draw           - A function to be repeatedly called at most n times per
                     second where n is the target frame-rate set for
                     the visualisation.

   :host           - String id of canvas element or DOM element itself.
                     Specifies host for the sketch. Must be specified in sketch,
                     may be omitted in defsketch. If ommitted in defsketch,
                     :host is set to the name of the sketch. If element with
                     specified id is not found on the page and page is empty -
                     new canvas element will be created. Used in ClojureScript.

   :focus-gained   - Called when the sketch gains focus.
                     Not supported in ClojureScript.

   :focus-lost     - Called when the sketch loses focus.
                     Not supported in ClojureScript.

   :mouse-entered  - Called when the mouse enters the sketch window.

   :mouse-exited   - Called when the mouse leaves the sketch window

   :mouse-pressed  - Called every time a mouse button is pressed.

   :mouse-released - Called every time a mouse button is released.

   :mouse-clicked  - called once after a mouse button has been pressed
                     and then released.

   :mouse-moved    - Called every time the mouse moves and a button is
                     not pressed.

   :mouse-dragged  - Called every time the mouse moves and a button is
                     pressed.

   :mouse-wheel    - Called every time mouse wheel is rotated.
                     Takes 1 argument - wheel rotation, an int.
                     Negative values if the mouse wheel was rotated
                     up/away from the user, and positive values
                     if the mouse wheel was rotated down/ towards the user

   :key-pressed    - Called every time any key is pressed.

   :key-released   - Called every time any key is released.

   :key-typed      - Called once every time non-modifier keys are
                     pressed.

   :on-close       - Called once, when sketch is closed
                     Not supported in ClojureScript.

   :middleware     - Vector of middleware to be applied to the sketch.
                     Middleware will be applied in the same order as in comp
                     function: [f g] will be applied as (f (g options)).

   :settings       - cousin of :setup. A function to be called once when
                     setting sketch up. Should be used only for (smooth) and
                     (no-smooth). Due to Processing limitations these functions
                     cannot be used neither in :setup nor in :draw."
