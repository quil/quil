  "Set various hints and hacks for the renderer. This is used to
  handle obscure rendering features that cannot be implemented in a
  consistent manner across renderers. Many options will often graduate
  to standard features instead of hints over time.

  Options:

  :enable-opengl-4x-smooth - Enable 4x anti-aliasing for OpenGL. This
     can help force anti-aliasing if it has not been enabled by the
     user. On some graphics cards, this can also be set by the
     graphics driver's control panel, however not all cards make this
     available. This hint must be called immediately after the size
     command because it resets the renderer, obliterating any settings
     and anything drawn (and like size(), re-running the code that
     came before it again).

  :disable-opengl-2x-smooth - In Processing 1.0, Processing always
    enables 2x smoothing when the OpenGL renderer is used. This hint
    disables the default 2x smoothing and returns the smoothing
    behavior found in earlier releases, where smooth and no-smooth
    could be used to enable and disable smoothing, though the quality
    was inferior.

  :enable-opengl-2x-smooth - Enables default OpenGL smoothing.

  :enable-native-fonts - Use the native version fonts when they are
    installed, rather than the bitmapped version from a .vlw
    file. This is useful with the default (or JAVA2D) renderer
    setting, as it will improve font rendering speed. This is not
    enabled by default, because it can be misleading while testing
    because the type will look great on your machine (because you have
    the font installed) but lousy on others' machines if the identical
    font is unavailable. This option can only be set per-sketch, and
    must be called before any use of text-font.

  :disable-native-fonts - Disables native font support.

  :disable-depth-test - Disable the zbuffer, allowing you to draw on
    top of everything at will. When depth testing is disabled, items
    will be drawn to the screen sequentially, like a painting. This
    hint is most often used to draw in 3D, then draw in 2D on top of
    it (for instance, to draw GUI controls in 2D on top of a 3D
    interface). Starting in release 0149, this will also clear the
    depth buffer. Restore the default with :enable-depth-test
    but note that with the depth buffer cleared, any 3D drawing that
    happens later in draw will ignore existing shapes on the screen.

  :enable-depth-test - Enables the zbuffer.

  :enable-depth-sort - Enable primitive z-sorting of triangles and
    lines in :p3d and :opengl rendering modes. This can slow
    performance considerably, and the algorithm is not yet perfect.

  :disable-depth-sort - Disables hint :enable-depth-sort

  :disable-opengl-error-report - Speeds up the OPENGL renderer setting
     by not checking for errors while running.

  :enable-opengl-error-report - Turns on OpenGL error checking

  noise is a random sequence generator producing a more natural

  been used since in graphical applications to produce procedural
  textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc.

  The main difference to the random function is that Perlin noise is
  defined in an infinite n-dimensional space where each pair of
  coordinates corresponds to a fixed semi-random value (fixed only for
  the lifespan of the program). The resulting value will always be
  between 0.0 and 1.0. Processing can compute 1D, 2D and 3D noise,
  depending on the number of coordinates given. The noise value can be
  animated by moving through the noise space and the 2nd and 3rd
  dimensions can also be interpreted as time.

  The actual noise is structured similar to an audio signal, in
  respect to the function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept
  of harmonics in physics, perlin noise is computed over several
  octaves which are added together for the final result.

  Another way to adjust the character of the resulting sequence is the
  scale of the input coordinates. As the function works within an
  infinite space the value of the coordinates doesn't matter as such,
  only the distance between successive coordinates does (eg. when
  using noise within a loop). As a general rule the smaller the
  difference between coordinates, the smoother the resulting noise
  sequence will be. Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most
  applications, but this will differ depending on use."

  octave contributing exactly half than its predecessor, starting at
  50% strength for the 1st octave. This falloff amount can be changed
  by adding an additional function parameter. Eg. a falloff factor of
  0.75 means each octave will now have 75% impact (25% less) of the
  previous lower octave. Any value between 0.0 and 1.0 is valid,
  however note that values greater than 0.5 might result in greater

   :key-pressed    - Called every time any key is pressed.

   :key-released   - Called every time any key is released.

   :key-typed      - Called once every time non-modifier keys are
                     pressed.

   :safe-draw-fn   - Catches and prints exceptions in the draw fn.
