  :title          - a string which will be displayed at the top of

  :size           - a vector of width and height. Defaults to
                    [500 300].

  :renderer       - The renderer to use. (one of :p2d, :java2d,
                    :opengl, :pdf or :dxf). Defaults to :java2d.

  :setup          - a fn to be called once when setting the applet up.

  :draw           - a fn to be repeatedly called at most n times per
                    second where n is the target frame-rate set for
                    the visualisation.

  :target         - one of :frame, :perm-frame. Default :frame.

  :focus-gained   - Called when the applet gains focus.

  :focus-lost     - Called when the applet loses focus.

  :mouse-entered  - Called when the mouse enters the applet window.

  :mouse-exited   - Called when the mouse leaves the applet window

  :mouse-pressed  - Called every time a mouse button is pressed.

  :mouse-released - Called every time a mouse button is released.

  :mouse-clicked  - called once after a mouse button has been pressed
                    and then released.

  :mouse-moved    - Called every time the mouse moves and a button is
                    not pressed.

  :mouse-dragged  - Called every time the mouse moves and a button is
                    pressed.

  :key-pressed    - Called every time any key is pressed.

  :key-released   - Called every time any key is released.

  :key-typed      - Called once every time non-modifier keys are
                    pressed."
