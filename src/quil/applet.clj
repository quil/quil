   :size           - a vector of width and height for the sketch.
                     Defaults to [500 300].

   :renderer       - Specify the renderer type. One of :p2d, :java2d,
                     :opengl, :pdf or :dxf). Defaults to :java2d. If
                     :pdf or :dxf is selected, :target is forced to
                     :none.

   :output-file    - Specify an output file path. Only used in :pdf
                     and :dxf render modes.

   :title          - a string which will be displayed at the top of
                     the sketch window.

   :target         - Specify the target. One of :frame, :perm-frame
                     or :none. Ignored if :pdf or :dxf renderer is
                     used.

   :decor          - Specify if the window should have OS frame
                     decorations. Only honoured with :frame or
                     :perm-frame targets.

   :setup          - a fn to be called once when setting the sketch up.

   :draw           - a fn to be repeatedly called at most n times per
                     second where n is the target frame-rate set for
                     the visualisation.

   :focus-gained   - Called when the sketch gains focus.

   :focus-lost     - Called when the sketch loses focus.

   :mouse-entered  - Called when the mouse enters the sketch window.

   :mouse-exited   - Called when the mouse leaves the sketch window

   :mouse-pressed  - Called every time a mouse button is pressed.

   :mouse-released - Called every time a mouse button is released.

   :mouse-clicked  - called once after a mouse button has been pressed
                     and then released.

   :mouse-moved    - Called every time the mouse moves and a button is
                     not pressed.

   :mouse-dragged  - Called every time the mouse moves and a button is
                     pressed.

   :key-pressed    - Called every time any key is pressed.

   :key-released   - Called every time any key is released.

   :key-typed      - Called once every time non-modifier keys are
                     pressed.

   :safe-draw-fn   - Catches and prints exceptions in the draw fn.
                     Default is true.

   :on-close       - Called once, when sketch is closed"
